# cps-gazebo-sim

## Included packages

* `multi_arm_lab_sim_description` - holds the sdf description of the simulated system and any other assets.

* `multi_arm_lab_sim_gazebo` - holds gazebo specific code and configurations. Namely this is where systems end up.

* `multi_arm_lab_sim_application` - holds ros2 specific code and configurations.

* `multi_arm_lab_sim_bringup` - holds launch files and high level utilities.

## Requirements
- Ubuntu Jammy 22.04
- CMake version >= 3.5
- Python 3.10

## Installation
1. [ROS2 Humble Hawksbill](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)
    > For convenience, add the following line to *.bashrc*. Other possible values are setup.sh, setup.zsh
    >```bash
    >source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    >```

2. Dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ~/cps-gazebo-sim
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    sudo rosdep init
    rosdep update
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -i -y --rosdistro humble
    ```

3. [Gazebo Fortress](https://gazebosim.org/docs/fortress/install_ubuntu)
4. `ros-gz` package which includes the necessary bridges and interfaces between ROS2 Humble and Gazebo Fortress
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install ros-humble-ros-gz
    ```
5. Install Interbotix robot packages
https://docs.trossenrobotics.com/interbotix_xsarms_docs/ros_interface/ros2/software_setup.html#amd64-architecture
(instead of 6. maybe edit the github source links for repos that I modified. in the xsarm_amd64_install.sh script)
6. Update sources by running (*insert my script which updates remote urls to my customized repos*)

7. [MoveIt2](https://moveit.ros.org/install-moveit2/binary/)
```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-moveit
```

### Drivers for Robots

|UR3e series|https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/tree/humble|

## To run

Build
```bash
cd ~/workspace
colcon build --cmake-args -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
```
Run
```bash
# source the workspace
. ~/workspace/install/setup.sh
# launch the simulation and visualize in RViz
ros2 launch multi_arm_lab_sim_bringup ur3e.launch.py
```

## Communication between ROS2 and Gazebo
Gazeboâ†’ROS2
```bash
ros2 run ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge /TOPIC@ROS_MSG@IGN_MSG
```
>The ROS message type is followed by an @, [, or ] symbol where:
>
>- @ is a bidirectional bridge.
>- [ is a bridge from Ignition to ROS.
>- ] is a bridge from ROS to Ignition.

[More info on message types and bridge communication](https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/blob/ros2/ros_gz_bridge/README.md#example-1a-ignition-transport-talker-and-ros-2-listener)
> For example,
> ```bash
>ros2 run ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge /diff_drive/cmd_vel@geometry_msgs/msg/Twist]ignition.msgs.Twist
>```
>```bash
>ros2 topic pub /diff_drive/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear: { x: 0.1 }"
>```

```bash
# list topics in the Ignition simulation environment
ign topic -l
# list topics in a ROS 2 system
ros2 topic list
# print messages published to a topic
ros2 topic echo /TOPIC
```

## Testing
```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-launch-testing
```
Compile and run tests:
```bash
colcon test --ctest-args tests [package_selection_args]
```
See test results:
```bash
colcon test-result --all
```
Add `--verbose` flag to see failing test cases.
