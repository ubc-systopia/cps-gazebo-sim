## Communication
Gazeboâ†’ROS2
```bash
ros2 run ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge /TOPIC@ROS_MSG@IGN_MSG
```
>The ROS message type is followed by an @, [, or ] symbol where:
>
>- @ is a bidirectional bridge.
>- [ is a bridge from Ignition to ROS.
>- ] is a bridge from ROS to Ignition.

[More info on message types and bridge communication](https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/blob/ros2/ros_gz_bridge/README.md#example-1a-ignition-transport-talker-and-ros-2-listener)
> For example,
> ```bash
>ros2 run ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge /diff_drive/cmd_vel@geometry_msgs/msg/Twist]ignition.msgs.Twist
>```
>```bash
>ros2 topic pub /diff_drive/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear: { x: 0.1 }"
>```

```bash
# list topics in the Ignition simulation environment
ign topic -l
# list topics in a ROS 2 system
ros2 topic list
# print messages published to a topic
ros2 topic echo /TOPIC
```
